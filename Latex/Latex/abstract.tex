\abstract{The analysis of music has always been an interesting topic for music theorists for helping in music teaching, analysis of human perception of sounds and for design of music search and organization tools. Moreover, a typical goal is to segment a given piece with the goal of interring interrelationships among motive and themes within the music. And analyzing sequential data has been a problem in statistical modeling for several years. The goal of this project is to use Bayesian inference to analyze a music piece. We consider a music piece as a sequential data and and we want to segment the piece using a non-parametric Bayesian model. The music, to be represented as a discrete sequence of observations is processed and then modeled using a Hidden Markov Chain model. The segmentation is inferred by the model and compared to our music-theoretic analysis. Our method is mainly a combination of the papers by Lu Ren and al. \cite{ren_music_2009} and  Emily B. Fox and al. \cite{fox_sticky_2011}.
