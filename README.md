# MusicAnalysis-Bayesian_DynamicModel
Study of the paper by Lu Ren, David B Dunson, Scott Lindroth and Lawrence Carin *Music Analysis with a Bayasian Dynamic Model*

## Data 
The data used is a music, represented by a sequence of discrete observations modeled with a Hidden Markov Chain (HMM) with time evolving parameters. 

## Assumptions 
* Temporal proximity = more likely the observations are drawn from a HMM with similar parameters
* Innovation = abrupt changes in the music texture

## Model inference
Music segmentation using the HMM model comapred to a music-theoretic analysis.
