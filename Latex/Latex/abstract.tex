\abstract{The goal of this project is to use Bayesian inference to analyze a music piece. We consider a music piece as a sequential data and segment the piece using a non-parametric Bayesian model. The music, to be represented as a discrete sequence of observations is processed and then modeled using a Hidden Markov Chain model. The segmentation is inferred by the model and compared to our music-theoretic analysis. Our method is mainly a combination of the papers by Lu Ren and al.\ref{a} and  Emily B. Fox and al. \ref{DUMMY:1}.
